# Ideas for hiking. Selected Destinations and Attractions

The world has a great many tourist regions suitable for hiking. On our site we are still limited to the Alps, but even there the number of possible options is huge, and therefore for each region we have posted only brief reference data. However, where does one begin to develop an alpine region? To help, we have prepared a special review of the "selected" regions. It was formed primarily on the basis of our own hiking experience in the Alps, it is also information about the regions where we planned or plan to go, and, finally, this is information from the reports of other tourists we liked that we found on the Internet.
