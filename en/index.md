Hiking give fine possibility to us to estimate width and a variety of the nature. It brings to us elation and gives feeling of gratitude for ours existence. It connects us with that nature from which we have occurred and from which we are created. Hiking is also an excellent way to plunge into the nature for one day and an easy adventure, which you can spend on days off to leave from city vanity and to freshen yourselves till the morning on Monday.

In hiking we are involved with absence of necessity always to fill silence with words. You do not need to speak anything when you lie under stars or look in deep mountain gorge. Thus you have a feeling of surprise, extensiveness and sense.

The hiking gives the chance to you to see absolutely tremendous landscapes which you simply do not receive in a city and cannot see from the car. You are waited for by beauty of mountain landscapes, lakes, falls, risings and sunsets.

Sense of achievement - the key moment in mountain hiking. Climbing up on an abrupt mountain you remember that, as the spirit of adventurism is not alien to you.

The hiking allows to us to take pleasure in feeling of autonomy. You can take and bear with yourselves everything that it is necessary for you for life, movement, a food and a lodging for the night. Check up to the ability to cook food, to equip "house", to clean itself and the clothes, using [the map](maps), a compass or GPS to find the way and to be ready to feel comfortable in any conditions.
