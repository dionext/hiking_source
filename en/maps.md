# Cartography (maps)

From our point of view, the map are the main organizational and inspiring means of the hiker. Also they can be used for entertainment :).

![](../images/cards2.jpg)

Further we result the survey of the most popular cartographical means and tools. The basic attention is given computer means that at all does not cancel for each tourist of necessity to have at itself and the paper map (the accumulator in which will never be discharged and will not bring you during the most necessary moment).

[![](../images/pixabay/compass-3072364_640.jpg)](../images/pixabay/compass-3072364_1280.jpg) [Image by PixLord from Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/compass-hiking-outdoor-travel-3072364/)

In each section of means are sorted as their popularity and efficiency for the hikers (from our point of view).

## Paper maps

Paper topographic maps can be got in bookshops, booths at stations and the airports, the local tourist offices and in hotels where you live.

On the Alpine region the authoritative publisher of maps considers Kompass Karten. It is the Austrian publisher of maps who are based in Innsbruck who specialises on foot maps and guidebooks, digital maps, and also on bicycle maps and ​​ guidebooks.

KOMPASS has about 1,000 titles in its programme, including 700 hiking, cycling and ski touring maps. Just under 500 hiking maps have been published covering the hiking areas of Austria, South Tyrol, Germany, the Balearic and Canary Islands. Hiking regions in the rest of Italy, the Swiss Alps, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have some coverage. The maps are mainly published at a scale of 1:25,000 or 1:50,000, with trails, footpaths and additional tourist information highlighted. The new generation of hiking maps is printed with c coordinate grid for GPS navigation. Since mid-2011 weatherproof and rip-resistant maps have been printed, gradually replacing the existing maps.

KOMPASS-Verlag has just under fifty digital maps in its range, covering the whole of Austria, several walking areas in Germany, South Tyrol, the Canaries, the Balearics, Malta and Elba. The digital maps are usable on PDAs and mobile phones using Java technology for outdoor navigation. The map material is at a scale of 1:50,000 zoomable to 1:10,000.

Since 2009 there has been a cycling map series at a scale of 1:70,000. In 2011 a cycling guide series appeared. Both are printed on rip-resistant and weatherproof paper.

The company also publishes hiking atlases, nature guides, panoramas, cookery books and ski tour guides.

## Online maps

### Google Maps

Service represents the map and satellite pictures of mother Earth. For today it is the most popular online the map. [https://www.google.ru/maps/](https://www.google.ru/maps/)

### OpenStreetMap

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. Rather than the map itself, the data generated by the project is considered its primary output. The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map information across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices.\[6\] OSM is considered a prominent example of volunteered geographic information. [https://www.openstreetmap.org/](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)

### kompass.de

## GPS tracks

[![](../images/pixabay/crossroads-1595989_640.jpg)](../images/pixabay/crossroads-1595989_1280.jpg) [Image by Gianni Crestani from Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/crossroads-mountain-hiking-rock-1595989/)

The track is a sequence of points of GPS coordinates with marks of time of their passage. As a rule, it is generated by special devices (navigators) or special sofrtware for computers and smartphones. That is, someone has passed a certain route with the included navigator who preserved every second current coordinates in a file. Such track can be loaded in the navigator or special software for computers and smartphones that then to pass the same route. There are public storehouses of tracks on the Internet where it is possible to look at the user tracks and to download them to themselves on the computer device. Also it is possible to load the track into the given storehouse to share it with tourist community.

Using a track for route passage, it is not necessary to forget that the track not always can coincide with an optimum route, and also not always coincide with available tracks and roads. In most cases such coincidence will take place, but not always. The tourist who has written down a track, could descend periodically from a track aside or even it could appear for some time in position "lost the way". The track (especially it concerns mountain tracks) could change the thread eventually. All should be meant it.

Anyway, the analysis of another's tracks is useful at route planning.

[![](../images/pixabay/globe-2707935_640.jpg)](../images/pixabay/globe-2707935_1280.jpg) [Image by bluebudgie from Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/globe-compass-travel-geography-2707935/)

There are various formats for tracks. But many modern devices/on support loading of tracks in several formats. As a last resort always it is possible to use programs for converting from one format in another.

Popular formats are: GPX (GPS eXchange Format), TCX, KML and KMZ (Google Earth), PLT (a format of program OziExplorer), GDB (Garmin Mapsource)

### How to write down GPS tracks

#### Wikiloc - World Footpaths

The most known storehouse GPS of tracks. The data from it uses Google Earth. On our site you can find on page of each region the reference for transition to site Wikiloc on which the map with display GPS of tracks of the given area will open.

Official site [https://wikiloc.com/](https://ru.wikiloc.com/)

On 03.2019 on Wikiloc 4 436 675 participants were registered, 11 234 084 tracks and 19 788 477 photos are added. There are appendices for iPhone and Android. The expanded functions are accessible for Premium an account. Since 2008 it is used Google to show tracks as a layer by default on Google Earth. There is the Russian interface, one mainly is an English-speaking site.  
The key idea Wikiloc formulated on their site: "We believe in a future where humanity spends more time enjoying and preserving the outdoors. Our goal is to help people have better experiences in community before, during and after outdoor activities and to inspire and support the preservation of nature.".  
There is a search by he map and by the region name. For search of a track in Europe it is necessary to use English-speaking names. For track downloading registration is required. Formats: GPX, TCX, a KML-file (a format for Google Earth), Garmin. Probably to receive a code for an insert of the information on a track in socila network or web site.

## Computer and the software

### Software for desktop

#### Google Mother Earth (Google Earth)

Google Mother Earth (English Google Earth) - company Google project in which frameworks in a net the Internet have been placed satellite (or in some points of an aerophoto) images of all terrestrial surface. Photos of some regions have the high permission is unprecedented. Google mother Earth is displayed in the form of the digital globe which displays a planet surface using one compound image from the big distance. At the big increase in the image pass in various images of the same area with more fine details which can differ on date and time of shooting from one area to another. Google mother Earth has possibility to show to 3D-model of buildings, constructions and monuments. In separate cities, including the photorealistic. Unlike other similar services showing satellite pictures in the ordinary browser (for example, maps Google), in the given service client program Google Earth is used special, loaded on the computer of the user. Such approach though demands закачивания and program installations, but further provides the additional possibilities difficultly realised by means of the web interface.

There is also paid version Google Earth Plus and the free version Google Earth Pro, different support GPS of navigation, means of presentations and the raised permission of listing. [https://www.google.com/intl/ru/earth/](https://www.google.com/intl/ru/earth/)

[![The glanyj screen of the program](../images/google_earth/main_small.jpg)](../images/google_earth/main.jpg)

Until mid-2019, there was a Wikiloc track layer in Google Earth, which was quite convenient. However, the collaboration with Wikiloc is now terminated and this layer is not available. For the sake of history, we saved screenshots of how it all looked.
